Using **`terraform taint` (before deprecation)** or **`terraform apply -replace=<resource>` (recommended)** forces
**Terraform to delete and then recreate the same resource** with the same configuration.  

🔹 **Example:**  
If you run:  

terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.example

Terraform will:  
1️⃣ **Destroy (`delete`)** `aws_instance.example`.  
2️⃣ **Create (`recreate`)** a new `aws_instance.example` with the same configuration.  

Would you like a practical example with Terraform code? 😊
