Standarization of Pipelines
Reduce duplication of code
Easy onboarding of new applications, projects or teams
One place to fix issues with the shared or common code
Code Maintainence
Reduce the risk of errors


Instead of writing the same code again and again in multiple pipelines, you can create a shared library and 
use it in all the pipelines that need it. This can make your code more organized and easier to maintain.
