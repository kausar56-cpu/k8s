Top EKS Troubleshooting Part= 02 
1. You have an Nginx-based Ingress controller in your Kubernetes cluster that is responsible for routing traffic to 
multiple services. Users are reporting intermittent 502 Bad Gateway errors.
2. Your Kubernetes pods are stuck in a "Terminating" state for an extended period.
How would you investigate and resolve this issue? ðŸš€
3. You are managing an Amazon EKS cluster, and a developer reports that their application pods are stuck in the "Pending" 
state. The developer has already verified that the application's YAML configuration is correct. As the cluster administrator, how would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
4.You
 notice that some pods in your EKS cluster are frequently restarting. The logs indicate that the application is running out of 
memory. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
5. You notice that a deployment in your EKS cluster is not updating properly. When you apply a new version of the deployment YAML, 
the pods are not being recreated with the updated configuration. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
6. You notice that a service in your EKS cluster is not routing traffic to the correct pods. The service is supposed to route traffic
to pods with the label app=my-app, but itâ€™s not working as expected. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
7. You notice that a node in your EKS cluster is in a NotReady state. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
8. You have configured an HPA for a deployment in your EKS cluster to scale based on CPU utilization. However, you notice that the HPA 
is not scaling the pods as expected. The CPU utilization is high, 
but the number of pods remains the same. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?


Top EKS Troubleshooting Part-01
1. Your EKS cluster is running multiple microservices, and one of them is suddenly experiencing high latency and
intermittent failures. How would you approach troubleshooting this issue?
2. Your EKS cluster is using AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) as an ingress controller. Users report that some requests are timing out while others succeed. 
How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
3. Your EKS cluster is experiencing intermittent DNS resolution failuresâ€”some pods are unable to resolve external domains (e.g., google.com
), while others work fine. How would you troubleshoot and fix this issue?
4. Your EKS cluster has a high number of pod evictions, and some workloads are frequently getting evicted and rescheduled across 
nodes. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
5. One of your EKS pods is repeatedly getting OOMKilled (Out of Memory Killed). How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
6. One of your EKS pods is stuck in a CrashLoopBackOff state. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
7. When a pod fails to resolve an external or internal domain, DNS resolution issues might be the root cause.
Here's how to systematically debug and fix the problem.
8. You notice that one of your pods in Amazon EKS is stuck in the ContainerCreating state for an extended period.
How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
9. Your EKS worker nodes are in a NotReady state, and workloads are not running properly.
