static pod creted by kubelet
pod crted by demonset ignored ny kube shduler
kubelet is only component run as demon service
lets we have 6 inginx pod should acrooss multiple node 1 and 2
kubelet insure are all this conatiner running correctly if fail it - it will restart container and reporet to control plan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kubeproxy assign ip uniq to each pods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in realtime k8s cluster deploy with help only KOPS only becoz
1. in backend when it depoly automaticaly depoly autoscalling group
2. someone try to delee master node or node it will create automaticaly nodes

PODS: PODS ARE NOTHING BUT, ITS A WRAPPER WHICH CONTAINS ONE OR MORE CONTAINERS

ReplicaSet independently delete केला → Pods पण delete होतील, पुन्हा तयार होणार नाहीत.

ReplicaSet Deployment ने manage केलेलं असेल → delete केला तरी Deployment लगेच नवीन ReplicaSet + नवीन Pods तयार करेल.

I am working on k8s application - and suddenly product manager came - can u integrate the database into the K8s application  - this is an external database not from another region 
this database accesses all teams because 
it contains product info
customer feedback 
reviews
The main advantage of integrating a database with Kubernetes is that the database 
gets a hostname (unique URL), making it easier to manage across multiple applications.


By default, every Pod gets a **default Service Account**, but we can create custom Service Accounts to provide 
specific permissions using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)."












What is kubectx?
kubectx is a CLI tool that simplifies switching between multiple Kubernetes contexts in a kubeconfig file. 
Instead of using kubectl config use-context, you can use a short and quick command.
openssl genrsa -out user1.key 2048

if my devoplper requre some 4 gb volume he caaot attact dirctly to node 
he should be clame it 

bunded means
before state - it will be avilable state which means 
If it is not bound to any PVC it will be showing as available once it has been claimed, and then the statue will turn to bounded
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if soppose all pv bounded - still devlper want 20gb gp2 volume - its possible dynamic PV cliam
how?
whenever devolper raising cliam
when deploying cluster with kops at backend storage class will be crteated - storage gp2 Imidiate class which mean
if thre no pv remains - with help of storage class its possible - but its gooing to create volume as a dynamic provisioning cliam 


node selector and node affinity diff 
In the node selector, we can pass a single expression  here
but in node affinity, we can pass multiple match expressions heare          -------vamp

actually in real-time they will have licensed keys, .crt, and .key. The only thing we have to do is,  
we have to follow the process that I showed in the video.
