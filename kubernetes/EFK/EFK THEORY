EFK is a centralized logging solution that consists of three open-source tools:

Elasticsearch → Stores and indexes logs (Log Lake)
Fluentd → Collects, processes, and ships logs - shift log from container to elastic serch database
Kibana → Visualizes logs and provides analytics - provide grafical UI - to qury the logs from elastic serch

• EFk stack provides centralized logging in order to identify problems with
servers or applications
 It allows you to search all the logs in a single place
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when we running application in production env multiple user accessing our application 
there is chance of getting aception in our application 

application running in multiple machine and multiple container 
monitoring all log of container will be very difficulty task to avoid that problem 
we need to segracate log of application , we should provide single platform to get all 
logs of application that why efk stack comes in picture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
our application is running multiple container 
those container going to genrate logs - those logs should collet by fluent D - it will send logs to elastic serch-
it will gives logs to kibana- we will use kibana dhasbord to get logs of application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in cluster we are going to install fluentd , elastic serch and kibana.
fluent d install as deamon set -that should collect logs from all pods , all the node and give it to elastice serch 

elastic sech deploed by using satefullset- it will maintain value of store that logs whic are given by fluent D 
at backend of elasticserch- PVC is present

kibana deploed by using deployment- it will provide UI - to monitor logs of application 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ELASTIC SERCH url configure in kibana yaml to intregate them
kibana pod will expose as load balancer service so we can access kibana dhasboard outside of cluster

elastic serch service = cluster ip
kibana= LB
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
access kibana through 5601- lb - in that discover option - there we need to crete index patern - to get logs of our applicayion
index name = *
click on next step
time filter field name = @timestamp
click crete index patern
go back to discover option - hear we can monitor - clster logs and application logs aloso

 How to Create a User in Kibana (for Elasticsearch Security)
In Kibana, user management is handled by Elasticsearch's security features. You can create users via:
✅ Kibana UI
✅ Elasticsearch API

🔹 Prerequisite: You must have Elasticsearch Security enabled (Basic license includes authentication).

✅ Method 1: Using Kibana UI (Easiest)
1️⃣ Login to Kibana as an admin.
2️⃣ Go to "Stack Management" → "Security" → "Users".
3️⃣ Click "Create user".
4️⃣ Fill in user details:

Username (e.g., new-user)
Password
Roles (e.g., kibana_user, read, or custom roles)
5️⃣ Click Save.
✅ Now, the user can log in to Kibana with the assigned roles.
