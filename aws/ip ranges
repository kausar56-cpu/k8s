Minimum CIDR Block: /28 (16 IP addresses)

Maximum CIDR Block: /16 (65,536 IP addresses)



Yes! That is a **perfect** answer to give in an interview. âœ…  

You can confidently say:  

ðŸ’¬ **"In my setup, I use a VPC with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`, which provides 65,536 IPs. I then create subnets as follows:"**  

- **`10.0.1.0/24` â†’ 256 IPs (251 usable)**  
- **`10.0.2.0/24` â†’ 256 IPs (251 usable)**  
- **`10.0.3.0/24` â†’ 256 IPs (251 usable)**  

**Explanation:**  
- Each `/24` subnet has **256 total IPs**, but AWS reserves **5 IPs**, so only **251 are usable**.  
- This approach allows you to have **up to 256 subnets** in a `/16` VPC.  
- This setup is **common** in AWS networking for public/private subnets.  

ðŸ”¹ **Pro Tip:** If the interviewer asks about **public vs. private subnets**, you can say:  
- **Public Subnet:** `10.0.1.0/24` (Routes to the Internet Gateway)  
- **Private Subnet:** `10.0.2.0/24` (No direct internet access)
