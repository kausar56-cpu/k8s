crete bucket s3 - add policy 
ACLS enabled - uncheck public access 
crete vpc 1 public and 1private subnet cwithout endpoint
then cret 2ec2 1 private 2. public
on public ec2 nano pem.key - add key
chmod 400 pem.key
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@10.0.140.151
creat nat gatway - selet public subnet
go to add routs -select destination - nat gatway
throught his we can access it but we dont need go through internet we have make connection s3 and private subnet
so now we have delete nat

AWS provides two types of VPC Endpoints:
1. Interface Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
Supports services like SSM, S3, DynamoDB, EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch Logs, Secrets Manager, etc.

2. Gateway Endpoints
Only available for S3 and DynamoDB.


vpcendpoint - select aws servies- serch for s3 -vpc select- select private subnet -



Exactly! ðŸŽ¯ VPC Endpoint = Access only, No actions ðŸš«
If you want to perform tasks, you need SSM (with an SSM VPC Endpoint if no internet).

It looks like you're trying to set up AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager for instances in a private subnet using VPC endpoints. Here's a structured approach to make sure it works:  

### **Steps to Enable SSM in a Private Subnet**  

#### **1. Create VPC Endpoints for SSM**  
Since your instance is in a private subnet (without internet access), you need VPC endpoints for SSM services.  

Go to **VPC > Endpoints > Create Endpoint**, and create the following:  

1. **com.amazonaws.<region>.ssm** (For SSM API calls)  
   - Select **Private Route Table**  
   - Associate with **Private Subnet**  
   - Use security group allowing traffic from private instances  
   
2. **com.amazonaws.<region>.ssm-messages** (For communication between instances and SSM)  
   - Select **Private Subnet**  
   - Attach Security Group that allows EC2 communication  

3. **com.amazonaws.<region>.ec2messages** (For SSM Agent communication)  
   - Select **Private Subnet**  
   - Attach Security Group  

#### **2. Attach IAM Role to EC2 Instance**  
- Go to **IAM > Roles**  
- Attach **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** policy to the EC2 IAM Role  

#### **3. Start a Session via SSM**  
1. **Go to AWS Console**  
2. **Navigate to**: Services > Management & Governance > Systems Manager > Session Manager  
3. Click **Start Session**  
4. Your private instance should now appear  

If only public instances are showing, ensure:  
âœ” The EC2 instance has the correct IAM role  
âœ” The VPC endpoints are properly created and associated  
âœ” Security groups allow communication between EC2 and the endpoints

**SSM (AWS Systems Manager)** is an AWS service that helps manage and automate operational tasks
on EC2 instances and other AWS resources.  

### **Key Features of SSM:**  
1. **Session Manager** â€“ Connect to EC2 instances (even private ones) without SSH or Bastion hosts.  
2. **Patch Manager** â€“ Automate OS and software updates.  
3. **Run Command** â€“ Execute commands remotely on multiple instances.  
4. **Inventory** â€“ Collect system details like installed applications and configurations.  
5. **Automation** â€“ Create workflows to manage AWS resources.
