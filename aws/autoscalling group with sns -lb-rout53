### **Auto Scaling Group with SNS, Load Balancer (LB), and Route 53**  

This setup ensures that your application scales automatically, is highly available, and notifies you of important events. Here's how it works:  

---

### **1. Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**  
- Launch an EC2 instance and configure it with the required application.  
- Create an **AMI** (Amazon Machine Image) of the instance.  
- Navigate to **EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups > Create Auto Scaling Group**  
- Use the AMI to launch instances.  
- Define **minimum, maximum, and desired instance count**.  
- Attach it to an existing **Load Balancer** (ALB/NLB).  
- Set **health check** to EC2 or ELB.

---

### **2. Attach SNS (Simple Notification Service)**  
- Go to **SNS > Create Topic** (Type: **Standard** or **FIFO**).  
- Subscribe via **Email, SMS, or Lambda** to receive notifications.  
- Configure ASG to send **scaling events** (instance launch, termination) to SNS.

---

### **3. Configure Load Balancer (ALB or NLB)**  
- Create an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**.  
- Define **Target Groups** and attach ASG instances.  
- Set **Health Checks** to ensure traffic goes only to healthy instances.  
- Add **Security Groups** for access control.

---

### **4. Set Up Route 53 for DNS Management**  
- Go to **Route 53 > Create Hosted Zone** for your domain.  
- Create an **Alias Record** pointing to the Load Balancer.  
- This ensures that users access the correct instances via a domain name.

---

### **How It Works Together**  
âœ” **ASG scales instances** based on load or health checks.  
âœ” **LB routes traffic** only to healthy instances.  
âœ” **Route 53 provides DNS resolution** for user requests.  
âœ” **SNS sends alerts** when instances launch or terminate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create an SNS Topic
Log in to AWS Management Console.

Go to the SNS Service:

Navigate to Topics in the left menu.

Click Create topic.

Fill in the details:

Type: Select Standard.

Name: Enter S3NotificationTopic.

Click Create topic.

Note down the Topic ARN (e.g., arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:S3NotificationTopic).

Step 2: Subscribe Your Email to the SNS Topic
Go to the SNS Topic created in Step 1.

Click Create subscription.

Set the subscription details:

Protocol: Choose Email.

Endpoint: Enter your email address.

Click Create subscription.

Open your email inbox and click the confirmation link in the AWS email to confirm your subscription.

Step 3: Update the SNS Topic Policy
Return to the SNS Topic in the SNS console.

Navigate to the Access Policy section (or edit topic settings).

Modify the policy to grant S3 permissions. Use the policy below, replacing:

BUCKET_NAME with your S3 bucket name (e.g., k8s-kausar-11-1-2025).

SNS_TOPIC_ARN with your SNS topic ARN from Step 1.



{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "SNS:Publish",
            "Resource": "SNS_TOPIC_ARN",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Save the updated policy.

Step 4: Configure S3 Event Notifications
Navigate to the S3 Service in AWS.

Select your bucket (k8s-kausar-11-1-2025).

Go to the Properties tab.

Scroll down to the Event Notifications section.

Click Create event notification.

Configure the event notification:

Name: Enter UploadDeleteNotification.

Event types: Check the following:

All object create events (for uploads).

All object delete events (for deletions).

Destination: Choose SNS Topic.

Select the topic created earlier (S3NotificationTopic).

Click Save changes.

Step 5: Test the Setup
Go to your S3 bucket (k8s-kausar-11-1-2025) in the S3 Console.

Upload a sample object:

Click Upload and add a file.

Check your email inbox for a notification about the upload.

Delete the uploaded object:

Select the object, click Delete, and confirm.

Verify that you receive another email notification for the deletion.
