Here are the full steps to create an **S3 Access Point**, upload a file, and use folders in S3:

---

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**

1. Open the **AWS Console** and go to **S3**.
2. Click on **Create bucket**.
3. Provide a **bucket name** (e.g., `my-bucket-name`).
4. Choose a **Region** (e.g., `us-east-1`).
5. Click **Create**.

---

### **Step 2: Create an S3 Access Point**

1. Go to **S3** in the AWS Console and select **Access Points** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Create access point**.
3. Choose the **bucket** you just created (`my-bucket-name`).
4. Provide a **name** for the access point (e.g., `developer1`).
5. Set **permissions** for the access point based on your needs (e.g., granting access to specific IAM users or roles).
6. Click **Create access point**.

---

### **Step 3: Set Permissions for Access Point (IAM)**

1. Go to **IAM** and select **Policies**.
2. Create a new policy that allows access to the access point. Example policy for `developer1` access point:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:431064776024:accesspoint/developer1"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:431064776024:accesspoint/developer1/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Attach this policy to the appropriate IAM user or role that you are using to access the bucket.

### **Step 4: Configure AWS CLI**

If you havenâ€™t set up AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS CLI**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install awscli
   ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   Run the following command and provide your AWS access key, secret key, and region:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Upload a File Using AWS CLI**

Now you can upload the file to the access point:

```bash
aws s3 cp saikiran.txt s3://arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:431064776024:accesspoint/developer1/folder1/terraform/
```

This will:
- Automatically create the folders `folder1/terraform/`.
- Upload `saikiran.txt` to the path `folder1/terraform/`.

---

### **Step 6: Verify the Upload**

To ensure the file is uploaded successfully, list the contents of the path:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:431064776024:accesspoint/developer1/folder1/terraform/
```

This should show the file `saikiran.txt` in the `terraform` folder.

---

### **Step 7: (Optional) Update Permissions if Necessary**

If you're having access issues, ensure the IAM policy is correct and that the user or role has permissions to interact with the access point.

---

That's it! These steps will guide you through creating an S3 access point, uploading a file, and managing folders. Let me know if you run into any issues!
