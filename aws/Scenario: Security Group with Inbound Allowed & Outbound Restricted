### **Scenario: Security Group with Inbound Allowed & Outbound Restricted**  

If a **Security Group (SG)** has **Inbound traffic allowed for all (0.0.0.0/0)** but **Outbound traffic restricted (denied for all)**, what happens? Let's break it down.  

---

### **1. Understanding Security Group Rules**  

| **Traffic Type** | **Configuration** | **Effect** |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Inbound (Incoming Traffic)** | `Allow All (0.0.0.0/0)` | Anyone from the internet can connect to your server on any open port. |
| **Outbound (Outgoing Traffic)** | `Deny All` (Restricted) | Your server cannot send any data outside, including internet requests. |

---

### **2. What Will Happen?**  

🔹 **Inbound Allowed (0.0.0.0/0) ⇒ Anyone from the internet can access your server.**  
🔹 **Outbound Denied ⇒ Your server cannot connect to the internet or external servers.**  

#### ✅ **What Will Work?**  
✔ You can **ping or SSH** into the server from an external network.  
✔ Websites or applications hosted on your server will be **accessible from the internet** (if ports like `80` or `443` are open).  
✔ If the request comes from within the **same VPC**, it may still work (depending on private networking).  

#### ❌ **What Won’t Work?**  
🚫 **No Internet access** → Commands like `apt update`, `yum install`, or `curl google.com` will fail.  
🚫 **No API calls** → Your application cannot connect to external APIs.  
🚫 **No database or external connections** → If your server needs to connect to an external DB or another service, it won’t work.  

---

### **3. Example Scenarios**  
#### **Scenario 1: Hosting a Website on Apache**  
- If **port 80 & 443 (HTTP & HTTPS) are open**, users can access your website.  
- But if your server needs to download updates (`apt update`, `wget`), it won’t work due to outbound restriction.  

#### **Scenario 2: Running a MySQL Database**  
- If MySQL is running and **Inbound (port 3306) is open**, external clients can connect.  
- But if MySQL needs to sync data with an external database, it **won’t be able to communicate** due to outbound restrictions.  

---

### **4. Solution (How to Fix)**  
If you need **internet access but want to maintain security**, you can:  

✅ **Allow specific outbound rules** (e.g., allow only `443` for HTTPS, `53` for DNS).  
✅ **Use a NAT Gateway** if your server is in a private subnet and needs internet access.  
✅ **Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway** if your server needs to communicate with other networks securely.  

---

### **5. Conclusion**  
📌 **Inbound Allow, Outbound Deny ⇒ Your server can be accessed from the internet, but it cannot access the internet.**  
📌 **For internet access, allow outbound rules or use NAT Gateway.**  
📌 **For private network communication, use VPC Peering or private endpoints.**

Here are **10 Security Group (SG) scenarios** with **simple explanations**:  

---

### **1. Public Web Server**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `80`, `443` (HTTP/HTTPS) from **anywhere** (`0.0.0.0/0`)  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all** (`0.0.0.0/0`)  
🔹 **Effect:** Website is accessible from the internet, and the server can access the internet (updates, API calls, etc.).  

---

### **2. Private Web Server**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `80`, `443` only from **VPC IP range**  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Only users inside the VPC can access the server, but the server can still access the internet.  

---

### **3. Block Internet Access**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow **all**  
🚫 **Outbound:** **Deny all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Server can receive requests from anywhere, but it **cannot make outgoing connections** (no internet access).  

---

### **4. Private Database**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `3306` (MySQL) **only from VPC**  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** The database is private. Only instances inside the VPC can connect, but it can sync with external DBs.  

---

### **5. Isolated Database**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `3306` **only from app server**  
🚫 **Outbound:** **Deny all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Only the app server can access the DB, but the DB **cannot connect to the internet**.  

---

### **6. SSH Bastion Host**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `22` (SSH) **only from trusted IPs**  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Only specific users can SSH into the bastion. The bastion can connect to other internal servers.  

---

### **7. NAT Gateway Server**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow **all from private subnet**  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Instances in the private subnet **route all internet traffic through this NAT server**.  

---

### **8. Block SSH & RDP**  
🚫 **Inbound:** **Deny `22`, `3389`** (SSH & RDP)  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** No SSH/RDP access, but the server can still connect to the internet.  

---

### **9. Load Balancer SG**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow `80`, `443` from `0.0.0.0/0`  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow traffic **only to backend servers**  
🔹 **Effect:** The load balancer can receive traffic from the internet and forward it to backend servers.  

---

### **10. Lambda Function SG**  
✅ **Inbound:** Allow **only API Gateway IPs**  
✅ **Outbound:** Allow **all**  
🔹 **Effect:** Lambda can **only receive requests** from API Gateway and **make external API calls** if needed.  

---

### **Summary**
- **Inbound allows requests in, outbound allows connections out.**  
- **Deny outbound = no internet access.**  
- **Deny inbound = no one can connect to the server.**
