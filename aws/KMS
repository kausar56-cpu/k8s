master key and data key

Master Key â€” One line definition would be that It is used to encrypt data. However, the
maximum size of data that can be encrypted using the master key is 4KB.
The master Key itself is classified into two types
1 -Customer Master Key(CMK)
2-Data Key

---------------------------
Customer Master Key(CMK): Customer Master Key is a schematic representation of the master
key. The schema contains
Key ID
Creation Date
Description
Key State
Key Material
------------------------------------------
Though KMS doesn't perform Asymmetric Encryption, it allows us to create Symmetric and
Asymmetric Customer Master Keys.
There is a limit of 10,000 CMKs per account per region by default. But you can always
request to limit an increase for the CMKs.
----------------------------------------------

Data Key
Since the master key by default cannot be used to encrypt data beyond 4KB, CMKs are used tc
generate data keys, which are in turn used to encrypt data outside KMS. The data key is used
encrypt and decrypt large volumes of data in other AWS Services such as S3, EC2, EBS, etc
Though KMS provide high availability as keys are stored in multiple availability zones within
a region, Customer Master Keys are unique to the AWS Account and your region.
