“The VPC CIDR range is decided by the user or network architect at the time of VPC creation. AWS doesn’t assign it.
It should be chosen from the private IP ranges, avoiding overlaps with on-premises or other VPCs.”




### **How to Identify Private vs. Public IP Addresses?**  

IP addresses are classified into **private** and **public** ranges. You can identify whether an IP is private or public based on its range.  

---

## **📌 Private IP Address Ranges (RFC 1918):**  
Private IPs are used inside local networks (LANs) and are **not routable on the internet.**  

| **Class** | **Private IP Range** | **Subnet Mask** |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Class A   | `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` | `255.0.0.0` |
| Class B   | `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` | `255.240.0.0` |
| Class C   | `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | `255.255.0.0` |

🚀 **Any IP falling within these ranges is a PRIVATE IP.**

## **📌 Public IP Addresses:**  
- Public IPs are **globally unique** and assigned by **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**.  
- They are **routable over the internet** and can be accessed globally.  
- Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS), `3.3.3.3` (AWS EC2 Instance).  

👉 **Any IP that is NOT in the private ranges is a PUBLIC IP.**

## **🔍 How to Check IP Type?**  

### **🔹 Using Linux CLI:**  
1️⃣ Check your system's private IP:  
```bash
ip a
```
or  
```bash
ifconfig
```

2️⃣ Check your public IP (Internet-facing):  
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```
or  
```bash
curl icanhazip.com
```

## **🔥 Summary:**  
✅ **Private IPs** → Used inside networks, cannot access the internet directly.  
✅ **Public IPs** → Used for internet communication, globally unique.  
✅ **Check IP type** → Compare with private IP ranges.
