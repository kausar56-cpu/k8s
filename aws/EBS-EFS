instance storage - 
1. its not good practice - why? default space get 8gb only /rroot
2. if u start ans stop data whatever data u kept it will gone
4 size and type fixed - t2micro , t2 midum
5 .if u alredy creat8 gb and now u want reqiured 5 gb then i have create EBS
6. u cannot attach or ditach volume to anyother instance

Here are the key steps from your history in note format:

- **Check Available Devices**:  
  - Use `lsblk` to ensure `/dev/xvdb1` or `/dev/xvdc1` exists and is properly recognized.

- **Create the Mount Point**:  
  - Use `sudo mkdir -p /ivo1` to create the mount point.

- **Verify the Filesystem**:  
  - Run `sudo file -s /dev/xvdb1` and `sudo file -s /dev/xvdc1` to check the filesystem type.
  - Ensure that the `mkfs.ext4` was successful on `/dev/xvdb1` and `/dev/xvdc1`.

- **Mount the Device**:  
  - Use `sudo mount /dev/xvdb1 /ivo1` to mount the first device.
  - If mounting a second device, create a new mount point:  
    `sudo mkdir -p /ivo2`  
    `sudo mount /dev/xvdc1 /ivo2`

- **Check for Errors**:  
  - Use `dmesg | tail -n 20` to see any error messages or logs related to the mount operation.

This summarizes your actions into clear notes. Let me know if you need more details on any step!

To make the mounted volumes persistent across reboots, you'll need to add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. This ensures that the volumes are automatically mounted when the system restarts.

Here’s the final step-by-step process to achieve persistence:

---

### Steps to Make the Mount Persistent:

1. **Find the UUID of the Volume**:
   - Run the command `sudo blkid` to find the UUID of your volume. This will provide the exact identifier for the device (e.g., `/dev/xvdb1` or `/dev/xvdc1`).

2. **Edit `/etc/fstab`**:
   - Open the `/etc/fstab` file in a text editor:  
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/fstab
     ```
   
3. **Add the Mount Information**:
   - Add the following line at the end of the `/etc/fstab` file to ensure the volumes are mounted automatically on boot:

     For `/dev/xvdb1` mounted to `/ivo1`:
     ```
     UUID=<UUID_of_xvdb1> /ivo1 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0
     ```

     For `/dev/xvdc1` mounted to `/ivo2`:
     ```
     UUID=<UUID_of_xvdc1> /ivo2 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0
     ```
   
   - Replace `<UUID_of_xvdb1>` and `<UUID_of_xvdc1>` with the actual UUIDs from the `blkid` command.

4. **Test the Mounting**:
   - To test if the configuration is correct and works without rebooting, run:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -a
     ```
   - This will mount all entries listed in `/etc/fstab`. Check if the volumes are properly mounted by running `df -h` or `lsblk`.

5. **Reboot**:
   - Reboot your system:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```
   - After the system reboots, check if the volumes are still mounted by using `df -h` or `lsblk`. They should now be mounted automatically.

---

### Final Outcome:
You’ve successfully made the mount persistent. Now, your EBS volumes (`/dev/xvdb1` and `/dev/xvdc1`) will be automatically mounted to `/ivo1` and `/ivo2` respectively, even after a system reboot.

Block Storage Elastic Block Storage (EBS) Volumes: Provides persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. 
Allows you to create, attach, and detach volumes to EC2 instances as needed. Supports different volume types optimized for various workloads, 
including General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2), and Throughput Optimized HDD (st1).
Instance Storage: Directly attached storage to EC2 instances. Provides high I/O performance but is non-persistent.
Data stored in instance storage is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated. 
Typically available in fixed sizes and types and limited to specific instance types.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File Storage AWS Elastic File System (EFS): Fully managed file storage service that supports NFSv4 protocol. 
Offers scalable and highly available file storage for Linux-based workloads, allowing multiple EC2 instances to access the same file system concurrently.
AWS FSx: Provides fully managed file systems optimized for Windows-based workloads, including Windows File Server and Lustre
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Storage Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3): Object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
Ideal for storing unstructured data, such as images, videos, documents, and backups. Offers high durability, availability, and scalability at a low cost.
Amazon Glacier: Low-cost storage service designed for long-term data archiving and backup. Offers multiple retrieval options with varying latency,
allowing you to optimize costs based on your access requirements. Advantages and 
Use Cases of EBS Volumes Permanent Storage: EBS volumes provide persistence, ensuring that data remains intact even
if the associated EC2 instance is stopped or terminated. Flexible Volume Types: Choose from a variety of EBS volume types optimized for different performance
and cost requirements, ranging from high-performance SSDs to cost-effective HDDs. Scalability and 
Attachment Flexibility: Easily scale EBS volumes up to 16TB in size and attach/detach them to different EC2 instances as needed. 
Practical Implementation and Best Practices Volume Provisioning and Mounting: Provision EBS volumes and mount them to EC2 instances using standard Linux commands
like lsblk, fdisk, mkfs, and mount. Update the /etc/fstab file to automatically mount EBS volumes at boot time.
Performance Optimization: Utilize different EBS volume types based on your application's performance requirements, ensuring optimal I/O performance
and cost-effectiveness. By understanding the various storage options available in AWS, including EBS volumes, you can architect scalable and reliable
storage solutions tailored to your specific workload requirements and budget constraints.
