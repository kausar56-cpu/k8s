how can you copy files from base machine to ec2 machine
-----------------------------------------------------------
12) Application deployed on ec2.I have to do routing from Chaitanya.com to
my application hosed on AWS. I want to route /home to something /profile to
mething else. How will you setup this routing ? What all aws services will you use ? ingress

✅ **Short Answer (English):**

For EC2, don't use Ingress. Instead, use:

* **Route 53** – for managing the domain (`chaitanya.com`)
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – for path-based routing like `/home`, `/profile`
* **Target Groups** – to direct traffic to different EC2 apps

Ingress is used only in Kubernetes, not with EC2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) You have an app running on EC2 in AWS account A. The product images are
stored in S3 bucket in AWS account B. What kind of setup will you do to fetch the images?

✅ Steps:
In Account B (S3 Bucket Owner):

Add a bucket policy to allow Account A to access objects:


{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-A-ID:root" },
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
}
In Account A (EC2 Owner):

Attach an IAM role to EC2 with s3:GetObject permission for that bucket.
Now, your EC2 in Account A can run:

aws s3 cp s3://bucket-name/image.jpg .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) How will you ensure that in your terraform configuration that
once vpc is created only after that its vpc id is fetched and passed
on to ec2 module ?

In Terraform, resource dependencies are handled automatically using references.
To ensure that EC2 is created only after VPC, we pass the VPC ID as an
input to the EC2 module:

h
Copy
Edit
module "vpc" {
  source = "./vpc"
}

module "ec2" {
  source = "./ec2"
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) Can we change pvt ip address of a running ec2 instance? Can you
change it after stoppoing the instance?

You cannot change the private IP of an EC2 instance while it is running.
In some cases, you can change it after stopping the instance.

If not possible, the best way is to Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) of the existing EC2 instance.

Terminate (delete) the old instance.

Launch a new EC2 instance from that AMI, and during launch:

You can manually assign a new private IP address (through the ENI settings),

Or let AWS automatically assign a new private IP.

12) Application deployed on ec2.I have to do routing from Chaitanya.com to
my application hosed on AWS. I want to route /home to something /profile to
mething else. How will you setup this routing ? What all aws services will you use ?



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)If I want to connect ec2 to s3 bucket but i dont want to use internet gateway
and nat gateway how will you establish communication between ec2
and s3 without internet?

"To allow EC2 in a private subnet to access S3 without using Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway, I would create 
a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. It enables private, secure communication over the AWS network."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) My Frontend application is hosted on ec2 in public subnet.
There are spikes in traffic sometimes. This Server is having slowness.
How to handle this problem and provide best solution?

Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and CloudWatch alarms to handle traffic 
spikes and ensure high availability. Optionally, use CloudFront to cache static content.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8) Your Auto scaling group is implemented. Now suppose that
your 80% cpu utilisations occurs, will it scale immediately
or wait for 15 minutes then scale ?

If you're using Target Tracking Policy (e.g., target CPU = 60%), and CPU reaches 80%,
ten Auto Scaling will scale immediately — it does not wait 15 minutes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)So now, There is CPU spike on your server and you scaled it up,
but when cpu reaches back to the normal value, does your
-
scaling method policy scales it down or how it behaves?

When CPU usage drops, Auto Scaling does not delete all EC2 instances suddenly. It scales down gradually
but always respects the minimum instance count defined in the Auto Scaling Group.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) What is cooldown period in aws auto scaling group?
The cooldown period in an AWS Auto Scaling Group is a waiting time after a scaling activity
(like scale in or scale out). During this time, no new scaling action will occur — it allows the s
ystem to stabilize before evaluating metrics again.

🔸 Example: If cooldown is 300 seconds, Auto Scaling will wait 5 minutes after launching an instance 
before taking another scaling decision.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26) I have created vpc and other infrastructure using Terraform.
Someone manually changed a rule in security group. If you run terraform
apply now, how will it behave ?

✅ Terraform will:
Detect drift between the current state and the actual infrastructure

Show in the plan that the manually added or changed rule is not in the code

Remove or revert the manual change during terraform apply (if it’s not in the .tf file)

🔁 Example:
If someone added a new inbound rule manually, and it's not in your Terraform code, terraform apply 
will remove that rule to match the .tf configuration.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32) | have created a vpc manually on aws. Now you are writing Terraform
configuration to create an ec2 inside this vpc. How will you do this if you dont
have access to aws console and have only vpc name?


"Since I only have the VPC name, I’ll use a data block in Terraform with a filter on the tag Name 
to fetch the VPC ID. Then, I’ll use aws_subnet_ids and aws_subnet data sources 
to fetch a subnet inside the VPC and use that to launch the EC2 instance."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45) Can we delete the image out of which my container is running ?
No, you cannot delete the image if a container is currently running from it.

🔍 Explanation:
When a container runs, it uses an image as its base. If the container is still running or even stopped
(but exists), the image is in use, and Docker will not allow deletion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ How to delete the image:
You must first stop and remove the container(s) using the image:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12) How do you take care of cleanup of temporary files in
workspace in jenkins ?
To clean up temporary files in Jenkins workspace, we use the Delete workspace option or add cleanup steps in the pipeline using:

groovy
Copy
Edit
post {
  always {
    cleanWs()
  }
}
