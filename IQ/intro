Thank you for giving me this great opportunity.

I am Kausar Mujawar, and I have 2.8 years of experience as an AWS DevOps Engineer.
 Initially, I worked on Linux and shell scripting, and later, I focused on AWS and DevOps.

In AWS, I have worked extensively with services like IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, SNS, and EBS.
 In the DevOps domain, I have managed GitHub repositories and have hands-on experience 
with Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

My daily responsibilities include checking emails, attending stand-up meetings, and
 handling assigned tickets. I build and manage CI/CD pipelines, troubleshoot build
 failures, and create IAM roles and policies as per requirements. I have also hosted 
static websites using S3 and built infrastructure as code with Terraform.

In Docker, I handle tasks like creating custom directories when space is full, port 
forwarding, attaching EBS volumes, and managing container networking. In Kubernetes,
 I troubleshoot issues like image pull errors and pending pods. I have worked with 
Deployments, ReplicaSets, Network Policies, StatefulSets, RBAC, and Ingress.

I am still learning Kubernetes, and thatâ€™s a brief about me.
