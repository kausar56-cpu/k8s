2.Difference betn persistent and mount bind volume in docker?
4.How will you push image to docker regisry from kubernetes cluster?
5.I am asking the mirror image 
3.How take back image that we recently lost? docker commit

5.Algorithm behind load balancer?

6.If there are 5 master node and 10 worker node is running and due to some issue 3 goes down could you tell me my k8s cluster will run of not?
7.How will you upgrade k8s cluster ?
8.Now lets take there is new user which is recently joined whose name is soham and i want to create that user and also i want create a role for him how can i do that?
9.which one is stable version in kubernetes?
10.k8s architecture?
11.In kubernetes how will you expose your application to external world so user can access it?
12.what is labels and selector?

13.How you can create a kubernetes cluster I am asking on on primise ?
14.In docker i have store the logs which is /var/etc/etc/dockerlog & because some issue if /etc2 folder is not working and you need make sure that this will not 
how will you do that like which you will change the loaction or like that type question could you gue which question he trying to asking ?

Docker I want to run docker image how will you that which os will it run on like windows or linux 
docker networking types
two containers are running on default networking can they talk with each other ?

vpc end points ?
RDS 
cloudfront - 
route53 - policy types and how we check health check ?
Let's take there is an person who created pods in kubernetes without creating deployment files and labels and now you want check it its created by default lables now 
Want change label how can you do that ? 
kubectl get pod <pod-name> --show-labels
kubectl label pod <pod-name> <label-key>=<label-value> --overwrite
kubectl label pod my-pod environment=production --overwrite
If let's take example there two application which deployed i.e two pods running on two differenet nodes in two different nodes now I want drain out 2 pods on one node that pods 
and want to run it on single node  how can I do that ?
There are different env like dev and staging there are modules of each resource if i want run my ec2 with duplication on terraform shall i do that?
What is null resource in terraform ?

How you store sectrets in kubenernetes like in sectret manager let's take you have created secrets how argocd knows that the particular 
secret is not synceed means thats not be pushed.

I  have deployed my application on ec2 instance and it's giving me 500 when user trying acces it via url name 

Docker
cmd and entrypoint
how you check the health of docker container have created mysql data base application by using statefulset now coz of some out of 4 1 pod is in crashloop backoff error now my question is 
if the pod state changed from crashloop backoff to ready state will it change the name of pod like earlie was mysql-001 
terraform there is an ebs there are different env dev env and staging env now i am doing terraform plan but changing the tag of that ebs how will you fix it 
I want to know the the ip of my mysql container without running exec command in docker as well in k8s
