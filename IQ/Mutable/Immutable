🔁 Mutable Tag
You can overwrite the same tag (e.g., latest) with a new image.

Default behavior.

❗Risk: Can lead to confusion or unexpected deployments.

🔒 Immutable Tag
Once pushed, the tag cannot be changed or overwritten.

Safer for CI/CD pipelines.

Ensures consistency and traceability.

✅ Use immutable tags in production to avoid deploying unintended images.
