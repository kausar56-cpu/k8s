🔁 Mutable Tag
You can overwrite the same tag (e.g., latest) with a new image.

Default behavior.

❗Risk: Can lead to confusion or unexpected deployments.

🔒 Immutable Tag
Once pushed, the tag cannot be changed or overwritten.

Safer for CI/CD pipelines.

Ensures consistency and traceability.

✅ Use immutable tags in production to avoid deploying unintended images.

You're right to clarify that — here's the corrected and simplified version:

### 🔹 Can we change the private IP of a running EC2 instance?

**No**, not while it's running.

### 🔹 Can we change it after stopping the instance?

**No**, because the private IP is assigned from the **VPC subnet** and tied to the **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**.
To change it, you must:

* **Detach the current ENI**
* **Attach a new ENI** with a different private IP from the same subnet

So technically, it’s possible **only by replacing the ENI**, not by directly editing the IP.

🚨 Issue: EC2 application is slow.

✅ Troubleshooting Steps:
Check CPU, memory, disk → top, free -m, df -h

Check application logs → for errors or delays

Check web server → Apache/Nginx status and logs

Check network → ping, security groups, route tables

Check CloudWatch → CPU, disk I/O, network metrics

Fix based on issue → Restart app, resize EC2, optimize code

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Fixing Storage Issues on EC2 (Short Answer):

1. **Check disk space:**
   `df -h` → Find which volume is full

2. **Clear space:**
   Delete logs, temp files → `sudo rm -rf /var/log/*`, `/tmp/*`

3. **Resize volume:**

   * Go to **AWS Console → EC2 → Volumes**
   * **Modify** volume size (e.g., from 8GB to 20GB)

4. **Extend file system:**
   After resizing, run:

   * `sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1`
   * `sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1` (or `xfs_growfs` if using XFS)

Done! Your storage issue is resolved.

### ✅ **CloudWatch Events vs Logs** (Short & Simple):

---

### 📅 **CloudWatch Events** (now called **EventBridge**):

* Triggers **automated actions** based on AWS events.
* Example:
  “When an EC2 instance stops, send an email or start another instance.”

---

### 📄 **CloudWatch Logs**:

* Stores and monitors **log files** from EC2, Lambda, RDS, etc.
* Example:
  “Application logs, system logs, error logs from EC2 are pushed to CloudWatch Logs for troubleshooting.”

---

### 🔑 Key Difference:

* **Events = Action-based triggers**
* **Logs = Log storage and analysis**
