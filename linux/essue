Last week, we faced a critical issue in our log processing pipeline. Our EC2 instance was supposed to upload logs to an S3 bucket, but suddenly, the Jenkins job started failing with:

❌ 403 Forbidden – Access Denied

At first, everything looked fine:
✅ IAM role had s3:PutObject permissions.
✅ S3 bucket existed, and the policy seemed correct.
✅ Jenkins pipeline was properly configured.
But still… ACCESS DENIED! 😤

🔍 The Debugging Process::

🛠 Step 1: Checked IAM Role Permissions → s3:ListBucket was missing!
🛠 Step 2: Reviewed S3 Bucket Policy → The policy didn't explicitly allow access for the EC2 role.
🛠 Step 3: Examined KMS Encryption → The bucket had KMS encryption, but the IAM role lacked kms:Encrypt and kms:Decrypt permissions.
🛠 Step 4: Tested with AWS CLI → Running aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket confirmed Access Denied.

💡 The Fix::

✅ Updated the IAM Role Policy to include s3:ListBucket.
✅ Modified the S3 Bucket Policy to explicitly allow EC2 access.
✅ Added KMS permissions (kms:Encrypt & kms:Decrypt).
✅ Retested the Jenkins job...SUCCESS! 🎉

🚀 Key Takeaways

🔹 Missing s3:ListBucket can break uploads, even if s3:PutObject is allowed.
🔹 KMS encryption requires additional permissions—don't overlook them!
🔹 Debugging with AWS CLI (aws s3 ls, aws s3 cp) helps pinpoint access issues fast.
This issue took hours to debug, but the learnings will last a lifetime! 💡

Imagine this: 
It’s a Friday evening, the team is wrapping up a major release, and suddenly… BOOM! A teammate accidentally runs:

git push --force origin main

In an instant, several production commits vanished! The CI/CD pipeline broke, deployments failed, and rollback options looked grim. 
Panic set in. 🚨

How We Recovered (in Real-Time):

🔹 Checked git reflog and GitHub commit history – Found the lost commits!
🔹 Reverted the damage using git reset --hard and git push --force-with-lease.
🔹 Enabled GitHub Branch Protection – No more force pushes to main.
🔹 Added Git Pre-Push Hooks – Now, developers get a warning before force pushing.
🔹 Mandated PR-based merges – Direct commits to main are now history.

Biggest Lessons Learned:
🚫 Never allow force pushes on critical branches.
🔄 Always have a rollback strategy (git reflog, GitHub backups, audit logs).
📌 Git best practices are a must—one small mistake can cause massive outages!

🚀 How GitHub Solved a Critical Deployment Challenge! 🔥
Few months back I have faced a major issue in production while deploying a microservices-based application. The problem? A last-minute bug that slipped through testing due to a misconfigured feature flag. 😨
✅ How GitHub Helped Us Recover Quickly:
1️⃣ GitHub Branching Strategy:
We follow a GitFlow approach, ensuring changes go through feature branches.
The bug originated in a hotfix, which needed an urgent patch.
2️⃣ GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
A rollback pipeline was already set up using GitHub Actions, so we quickly reverted to the last stable release.
We also improved our pre-merge testing automation to catch such issues earlier.
3️⃣ GitHub Security & Code Reviews:
Secret scanning ensured no API keys were exposed.
Code owners feature made sure the right reviewers were tagged for approvals.
4️⃣ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:
All infrastructure changes were version-controlled in GitHub, making rollbacks smooth and predictable.
💡 Key Takeaway:
GitHub is not just a code repository—it's a critical tool for collaboration, automation, and security in modern DevOps workflows. A well-structured GitHub workflow can save hours of downtime!

📌 Scenario: Your Maven builds are slow because dependencies are downloaded every time.
✅ Solution: Use a local repository cache and enable parallel builds for faster execution.
🔗 Quick Fix:
1️⃣ Configure Maven to use a local repository (settings.xml):

<localRepository>/home/user/.m2/repository</localRepository>

2️⃣ Run builds in parallel for multi-module projects:

mvn -T 4 clean install

🎯 Result: Drastically reduced build time, making your CI/CD pipelines more efficient!

Ever encountered a port conflict while managing multiple services on a single server? 🤔 It’s a common scenario where two applications compete for the same port, and the solution often involves changing one service’s port. I wanted to share a quick, structured guide!
Here’s how to change Jenkins’ default port (8080) to ensure smooth operations:
Step-by-Step Process:

1️⃣ Check Jenkins Status:
Run 
systemctl status jenkins 
to ensure the service is active. If not, start it with :
sudo systemctl start jenkins.
2️⃣ Identify the Current Port:
Navigate to the Jenkins service file location:

cd /usr/lib/systemd/system 
 
Locate the file:

ls -lrth | grep jenkins.service 

Check the current port:

cat jenkins.service 

3️⃣ Update the Port:
Open the service file for editing:

sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service 
Modify --httpPort=8080 to your desired port (e.g., --httpPort=9090).
4️⃣ Reload and Restart Jenkins:
Reload system configurations:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
Restart the Jenkins service:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins.service 

5️⃣ Verify the Changes:
Check if Jenkins is running on the new port:

sudo netstat -nltp | grep java 
Access Jenkins via the updated port (e.g., http://localhost:9090).
6️⃣ Update Inbound Rules:
Don’t forget to allow traffic on the new port in your firewall or cloud provider’s security group.

Key Takeaway ::
Changing the default Jenkins port is straightforward and can prevent unnecessary service conflicts. A small tweak can make your systems more reliable and scalable! 🔧
